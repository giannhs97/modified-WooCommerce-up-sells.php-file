The above file is the default WooCommerce up-sells.php file with a twist ;). I have modified the file so that i get all the up-sells of a product, and foreach one of them i get the child category. I then seperate them
according to the different category and display them under the category name. So we have Category A name and the up-sells that belong in this category and in the other line we have Category B name ans so goes on. So instead of
just having the up-sells showen next to each other with the default WooCommerce title above them we have the following schema.

Schema
Child Category A
up-sells of A
Child Category B
up-sells of B
